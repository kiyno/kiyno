- 👋 Hi, I’m @kiyno
- 👀 I’m interested in learning programming. I don't know anything yet, but I came across this site during the research I was doing about programming and they said it's good for those who are just starting out or are already advanced in the subject.
- 🌱 I want to start programming in the Lua language because I realized that it is very simple to learn and because I also want to make a game on Roblox. So as I found it "easier" I decided to start with it, but in the future I also want to learn about other languages.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate with those who want to learn too, but only after learning a little more lol
- 📫 How to reach me? You can add me on discord: kiynofeio (I'm Brazilian)
- 😄 Pronouns: him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't know anything about programming
